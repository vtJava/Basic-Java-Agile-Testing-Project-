Refactoring: package ie.gmit.dip
The refactored insurance program works by starting with a single scanner
in the class UserInput. The inputs are age integer and accident integer.
The getter methods for the cost integers surcharge & basic insurance are in the 
class Costs file. 
The AgeSelectionMenu class has a boolean called keepRunning placed at the end 
of the method to stop the menu. 
The AgeSelectionMenu loops in the method from class ChargeMenu.
The insurance program is started in the Runner class to go to the AgeSelectionMenu 
first. 

Future refactoring could be improved to have 2 menus in one class and using parameters 
in age menu to return type age, type age will be an input into the ChargeMenu. 
This would make testing simpler.

Testing process: 
Annotation interfaces created based on the import needs in package ie.gmit.dip.AnnotationsInterfaces
package ie.gmit.dip.test contains the testing java class files. 

CostsTest.java tests the getter methods to receive the correct cost values.
AgeSelectionMenuTest.java tests a timeout method to know the running time of the age menu 
& an assertNotNull check for the age parameter.
Tester.java tests two exceptions, beforeAll, afterAll, afterEach, Parameterised test for
the classes ChargeMenu and UserInput. 
ChargeMenuTest.java tests the class ChargeMenu methods.
TestAllJUnitClass runs all testing classes.

Testing can be improved with efficient refactoring of original code.
StackOverflow was searched on the method test if statements in original code.
